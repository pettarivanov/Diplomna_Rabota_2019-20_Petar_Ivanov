Here I will leave my thoughts on the projects and the struggles I am experiencing with it.

First of finding the right programmer was kinda easy.
The ST-Link V2 is easy to use.

Next up I am thinking of setting up a server.
I'm a student, so I won't be investing in something high end.
I was thinking, that I could buy an old, unused PC from eBay or something,
re-build it and host my server there.

I think I will be using a Debian based Linux for the server.
Anyway, that's for now.
