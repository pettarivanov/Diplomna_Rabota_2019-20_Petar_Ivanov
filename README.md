Here I will leave my toughts on the projects and the struggles I am expiriencing with it.

First of finding the right proggrammer was kinda easy.
The ST-Link V2 is easy to use.

Next up I am thinking of setting up a server.
I'm a student, so I wont be investing in something high end.
I was thinking, that I could buy an old,unused PC from Ebay or something,
re-build it and host my server there.

I think I will be using a Dabian based Linux for the server.
Anyway thats for now.
